    <p  id="about">pw skills <br>PW Skills aims to address the prevalent issue of inaccessibility and steep pricing of most tech and upskilling courses. These courses often lack a focus on practical training and the teaching of basics, emphasizing jargon instead. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in training availability in vernacular languages.</p>
